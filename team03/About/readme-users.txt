Once you start up our Unity game, you will see a large multi-colored "sphere" in front of the camera. At our current project state, you can shoot objects at the sphere and it will simulate energy propagation of the collision by changing the colors of the triangles upon impact. Here are the controls:

To Move, hold down the Right mouse button and use the W-A-S-D movement pattern.

To change settings of the projectile, interact with the combo boxes and sliders with the mouse by Left-clicking them.

To shoot the projectile, click on the "Launch" button or press the Space Bar.
